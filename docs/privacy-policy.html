    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="date">Last Updated: December 14, 2025</p>

    <p><strong>WhatsApp Micro-CRM</strong> ("we", "our", or "us") is dedicated to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our Chrome Extension.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We do not collect any personal data automatically. We only process data that you explicitly choose to "Snap" or save using the extension's interface.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Chat Content:</strong> When you click "Snap This Lead", the text of the currently open WhatsApp chat is temporarily processed to extract business insights.</li>
        <li><strong>Contact Information:</strong> We store the name of the contact associated with the snapped chat.</li>
        <li><strong>Account Info:</strong> We store your email address for authentication purposes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>The information we collect is used solely for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>AI Analysis:</strong> Chat text is sent to our secure backend and processed by OpenAI to generate summaries, lead scores, and action items.</li>
        <li><strong>CRM Functionality:</strong> Storing your leads and their details in your personal dashboard.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>Your data is stored securely in <strong>Supabase</strong>, a leader in open-source database solutions.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All data is encrypted in transit (HTTPS/SSL).</li>
        <li>Access to your data is protected by strict Row Level Security (RLS) policies, meaning only you can access your own leads.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We rely on the following third-party services to provide functionality:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>OpenAI:</strong> Used for processing text to generate insights. We do not use your data to train OpenAI models.</li>
        <li><strong>Supabase:</strong> Used for authentication and database hosting.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. User Control</h2>
    <p>You have full control over your data. You can delete any lead from your dashboard at any time, which permanently removes it from our database.</p>

    <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us via our GitHub repository.</p>
