## Full Description

STOP LOSING LEADS IN YOUR CHATS. 🛑

For Freelancers, Tutors, Photographers, and Agency Owners:
Your business runs on WhatsApp, but your leads are buried in endless chat history. You forget who promised to pay, who needs a follow-up, and how much money is in your pipeline.

WhatsApp Micro-CRM is the "Sidecar" that sits next to your chat and organizes your business automatically.

🚀 CORE FEATURES:
1. 📸 One-Click Snap: Instantly capture client details from any chat.
2. 🧠 AI Intelligence: Automatically extracts "Next Task", "Deal Value", and "Lead Status" (Hot/Warm/Cold).
3. 📊 Pipeline Dashboard: See all your active leads in one view. Know exactly how much revenue is pending.
4. 🔒 Bank-Grade Privacy: Your data is stored in your own isolated database. We never sell or share your client info.

💡 WHO IS THIS FOR?
- Wedding Photographers tracking inquiries.
- Private Tutors managing student fees.
- Real Estate Agents organizing property leads.
- Solo Founders who hate complex CRMs like Salesforce.

✨ HOW TO USE:
1. Open WhatsApp Web.
2. Open a client chat.
3. Click "Snap Chat".
4. Watch the AI organize your lead instantly.
