💡 The Problem & Solution
The Problem: Solo professionals (tutors, photographers, consultants) run their businesses on WhatsApp.

Leads get buried under personal chats.

"I'll pay you next week" promises are forgotten.

There is no "Dashboard" to see how much money is pending.

The Solution: A "Sidecar" extension for WhatsApp Web.

Snap: Extracts deal details (Name, Status, Money) from chat text using AI.

Save: Stores the lead in a cloud database (Supabase).

Track: Shows a "Pipeline View" of all active deals and total potential revenue.

🎯 Who Is This For?
Freelance Tutors: Tracking student inquiries and fee payments.

Wedding Photographers: Managing inquiry dates and booking deposits.

Real Estate Agents: Organizing hot leads vs. window shoppers.

Home Bakers/Cloud Kitchens: Tracking orders placed via DM.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Framework: Plasmo (React for Chrome Extensions)

UI: Tailwind CSS

Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL)

AI: OpenAI (GPT-4o-mini)

Language: TypeScript

3. Database Setup (Supabase)
Go to your Supabase SQL Editor and run this query to create the table:

create table leads (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
  name text,
  summary text,
  status text, -- 'Hot Lead', 'Closed', 'Cold'
  chat_log text
);

This is an unofficial tool. It scrapes the DOM of WhatsApp Web. If WhatsApp changes their class names (HTML structure), the scraper (scraper.ts) may need to be updated. Use responsibly.
