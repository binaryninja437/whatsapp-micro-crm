## 💡 The Problem & Solution

### ❌ The Problem

Solo professionals (tutors, photographers, consultants) run their businesses on **WhatsApp**:

- Leads get buried under personal chats  
- “I’ll pay you next week” promises are forgotten  
- No dashboard to see how much money is pending  

### ✅ The Solution

A **“Sidecar” browser extension** for WhatsApp Web.

- **Snap**: Extracts deal details (Name, Status, Money) from chat text using AI  
- **Save**: Stores the lead in a cloud database (Supabase)  
- **Track**: Shows a pipeline view of all active deals and total potential revenue

## 🎯 Who Is This For?

- **Freelance Tutors** – tracking student inquiries and fee payments  
- **Wedding Photographers** – managing inquiry dates and booking deposits  
- **Real Estate Agents** – organizing hot leads vs. window shoppers  
- **Home Bakers / Cloud Kitchens** – tracking orders placed via DMs

- **UI**: Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)  
- **AI**: OpenAI (GPT-4o-mini)
