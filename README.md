## 💡 The Problem & Solution
### The Problem
Solo professionals (tutors, photographers, consultants) run their entire business on **WhatsApp**, but WhatsApp was never designed to be a CRM:

- Leads get buried under personal and group chats  
- “I’ll pay you next week” promises are forgotten  
- No dashboard to track pending, active, or closed revenue  
- No visibility into how much money is actually on the table  

---
### The Solution
A **Sidecar CRM extension for WhatsApp Web** that works alongside your chats:

- **Snap** → Extracts deal details (Name, Status, Money) from chat text using AI  
- **Save** → Stores the lead securely in a cloud database (Supabase)  
- **Track** → Visual pipeline showing active deals and total potential revenue

- **Wedding Photographers** – Manage bookings, dates, and deposits  
- **Real Estate Agents** – Organize hot leads vs. window shoppers  
- **Home Bakers / Cloud Kitchens** – Track orders placed via DMs
